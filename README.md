Netapp Storage Capacity Export Scripts
======================================

Scripts use Netapp's DataONTAP Powershell commandlets to connect to storage controllers and export volume and aggregate space utilization, write to an output .csv file, and sftp the file to a unix host to be ingested by a reporting system.

###  Requires DataONTAP and PoSH-SSH modules
